# Lingo

An implementation of Martin-LÃ¶f Type Theory, following closely to the Homotopy Type Theory (HoTT) book.

## Induction

The notation for induction operators follows that of the HoTT book, e.g. defining the double function using natural induction would be:

```
double : Nat -> Nat
double := \n. ind[Nat](Nat, 0, n. y. succ(succ(y)), n)
```

# Implicits

Leading pi types can be left explicit by writing `{A : U} -> ...`. Semantically this is equivalent to a standard pi type, but it doesn't need a corresponding leading lambda in its definition. It also can be left out when applying another term to a term of this type.

For example, we can define and use the identity function with implicits like so:

```
id : {A : U} -> A -> A
id := \a. a

#check id 32
```

The check on the last line with give `id {Nat} 32 =>* 32 : Nat`.

Implicits can be made explicit in both a lambda and an application by using curly braces:

```
id : {A : U} -> A -> A
id := \{B}. \(a : B). a

#check id {Nat} 32
```

# Pragmas

Use the `#check` pragma to print out the normal form of the term supplied, along with it's type.

Using `#type` will print out the type of the given term, and `#eval` will print out the normal form of the given term.

Use the `#include` pragma to include another Lingo source file. For example,

```
#include "foo"
```

Will mean that the source of `foo.lingo` is included at the location of the include statement.
